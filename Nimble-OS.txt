NimbleOS

NimbleOS is the operating system that runs on HPE Nimble Storage arrays.

It provides all the data services of Nimble storage, such as:

Adaptive Flash technology (using SSD + HDD for performance + capacity).

Inline deduplication, compression, and snapshots.

Replication and disaster recovery features.

InfoSight integration (predictive analytics & monitoring).

Essentially, NimbleOS is to Nimble arrays what ONTAP is to NetApp or what IOS-XE is to Cisco devices — the software brain controlling the storage system.

HPE Nimble Storage Python SDK

HPE provides a Python SDK (Software Development Kit) to automate and manage NimbleOS features programmatically.

It is a wrapper around the Nimble REST API, so instead of manually calling API endpoints, you can use Python methods/classes.

Key points:

Distributed as nimble-python-sdk (available on GitHub and PyPI).

Supports operations like:

Create/manage volumes, snapshots, initiator groups.

Query performance stats, alerts, events.

Manage arrays, pools, replication partners.

Works with NimbleOS 5.x and newer.

Typical use cases:

Automating provisioning of storage for VMs/containers.

Integrating Nimble with CI/CD pipelines.

Health monitoring & reporting scripts.

Example (Python SDK use)
from nimbleclient import NimOSClient

# Connect to the Nimble array
client = NimOSClient("10.10.10.5", "admin", "yourpassword")

# List volumes
volumes = client.volumes.list()
for vol in volumes:
    print(f"Name: {vol['name']}, Size: {vol['size']}")

# Create a new volume
client.volumes.create(name="devops-vol", size=100 * 1024 ** 3)  # 100GB


Here, the NimOSClient is the main entry point; each resource (volumes, snapshots, etc.) is exposed as a class with CRUD operations.

✅ Summary
